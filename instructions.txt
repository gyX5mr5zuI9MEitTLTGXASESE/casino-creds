I uploaded the list to github. 

https://github.com/gyX5mr5zuI9MEitTLTGXASESE/casino-creds

The repository contains configuration files, and an xml version of a keepass file with different accounts.

Feel free to deplete their Twilio and Sendgrid accounts ;)

I destroyed several of their servers, so the rdp credentials dont work. 

But you would be able to find there a a lot of emails for social engineering and other goodies.

I do have a dump of their contacts. At this point I am not sure if to provide them for free.

However, you can create a tool to enumerate the phones:

Phone enumeration:
https://api.bet24star.com/api/Users/PhoneAuthentication?phone=[insert phone]

emails:
https://api.bet24star.com/api/Users/EmailAuthentication?email=[insert emails]

usernames:
https://api.bet24star.com/api/Users/UserNameAuthentication?username=[insert username]

on successful request, you should receive "1" instead of "0". Same logic applies to each of the requests.

They have this single site left:
https://bet24star.com/

It has a few good vulnerabilites. 

Bruteforce:
https://back.bet24star.com/auth
(dont worry about the captcha, it isnt being checked on the server).

(You get the username from the chatman in chat, or try to guess some of the names in the xml file that is in the git repository).

Automation:
Registration
KYC fileupload (Good target for DOS)

I also believe their chat has vulnerabilities. 

It is a good practice for beginner penetration testing or people who seriously want to hack a small organization. The organization has around 10 people.

Most of them are non technical, and vulnerable to social engineering. They are a good target for keyloggers and ransomware.

They look for ways to grow and expand, so it is good to keep an eye on them when they are small.
